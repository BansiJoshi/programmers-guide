Introduction to Big Data:
        'Big Data' is also a data but with a huge size. 'Big Data' is a term used to describe
collection of data that is huge in size and yet growing exponentially with time.In short,
such a data is so large and complex that none of the traditional data management tools are
able to store it or process it efficiently.
The Three ​Vs​​ of Big Data:

1) Volume
       The amount of data matters. With big data, you’ll have to process high volume of
low-density, unstructured data. This can be data of unknown value, such as Twitter data
feeds, clickstreams on a webpage or a mobile app, or sensor-enabled equipment. For some
organizations, this might be tens of terabytes of data.For others, it may be hundreds of
petabytes.

2) Velocity
       Velocity is the fast rate at which data is received and (perhaps) acted on.Normally,
the highest velocity of data streams directly into memory versus being written to disk.
Some internet-enabled smart products operate in real time or near real time and will
require real-time evaluation and action.

3) Variety
       Variety refers to the many types of data that are available. Traditional data types
were structured and fit neatly in a relational database. With the rise of big data, data
comes in new unstructured data types. Unstructured and semistructured data types, such
as text, audio, and video require additional preprocessing to derive meaning and support
metadata.

Future of big data:
       The Future of Big Data. Big data refers to data sets that are too large and complex
for traditional data processing and management applications. It has also become the
catch-all term for gathering, analyzing, and using massive amounts of digital information to
improve business operations.
